1\. Create a numpy array with numpy.array module and with data type integer and float.



2\. Create numpy arrays that have zero,one,two,three,Four dimensions respectively. Also, print the shape and dimensions of the numpy arrays created above.



3.Create a 2x3 , 3x3 and 4x4 identity matrix using numpy



4.Create a numpy array with shape 2x5 that has all elements as zero 5. create a numpy array that has shape 3x5 and all elements are 5.



5.#create numpy arraywith shape 2\*5 that has all elements zero zero = np.zeros((2, 5)) print(zero).



6\. Create a numpy array with random integers in the range 0-100 , and the sample size 25.



7\. create a numpy array with a shape 3x3 that has all elements as 1.



8\. create a numpy array in the shape 2x3 with random integers in the range 0-100. Reshape the array in the shape 3x2 and print the updated shape of the resultant array.

9.reshape a id array of size 12 into 3\*4 matrix

10.stack two arrays vertically and horizontally

11.create a random 1D arrayof size 10 and replace all values greater than 0.5 with 1, and the rest with 0

12\. create a random array,with range 0-1000, with a size 50. a. print first ten elements b. print last ten elements c. print the elements from indexes 10-25 d.print the element at the index 22 e. print the array using negative indexing f. print the last ten elements of the array using negative indexing.

13\. given a numpy array that has a values =\[1,2,3,4,5]. a. Insert the element 6 at the end of the array b. Insert the element 10 at the beginning of the array. c. Insert the elemnt 30, before 4. d. Update the element 5 as 50. e. Delete the element 50 in the updated array



14.create a function to search for the element 30     g.sort the array in ascending order.
